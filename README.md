# _Michelle Poterek's Resume_

#### _A webpage that contains my portfolio, resume, and an about-me section, {May 26, 2017_

#### By _**Michelle Poterek**_

## Description

_This webpage contains an initial index page with 3 subsections: resume, portfolio, and a bit about me. This is so a party interested in collaborating can navigate to the subsection they find most relevant to the aspect that they find important when choosing a web developer to work with._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Bootstrap v3.3.7 is being used. If for any reason bootstrap becomes incompatible, please use the Bootstrap CSS CDN and use that link in the top of the styleseets instead_
* _The webpage will largely work without internet connection once pages are loaded except for the background-image in the About Me_
* _Please access this page remotely via this web-address : https://poterekm.github.io/Poterek-Portfolio/index.html _
* _OR you can open up your terminal, type in "cd desktop", "git clone https://github.com/PoterekM/Poterek-Portfolio"


## Known Bugs

_The index page images scale to be larger than they were before they stack on each other when adjusting the browser size _

_The link to my project Cupcackles does not open the page_

_When viewed in a mobile version the project collaborator is under the image. I like the way this is and plan on fixing this for the desktop version._

## Support and contact details

_Please feel free to collaborate with me! You can fork my repository or feel free to e-mail me with any comments, questions, or feedback._
