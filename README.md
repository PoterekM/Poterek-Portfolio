# _Michelle Poterek's Resume_

#### _A webpage that contains my portfolio, resume, and an about-me section, {May 26, 2017_

#### By _**Michelle Poterek**_

## Description

_This webpage contains an initial index page with 3 subsections: resume, portfolio, and a bit about me. This is so a party interested in collaborating can navigate to the subsection they find most relevant to the aspect that they find important when choosing a web developer to work with._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Bootstrap v3.3.7 is being used. If for any reason bootstrap becomes incompatible, please use the Bootstrap CSS CDN and use that link in the top of the styleseets instead_
* _The webpage will largely work without internet connection once pages are loaded except for the background-image in the About Me_


## Known Bugs

_The index page images collide at certain break-points when adjusting the size of the browser window. I added a media query to pinpoint rough widths of when the page breaks._

_The link to my project cupcackles is a lost 404_

_When viewed in a mobile version the portfolio collaborator is under the image. I like the way this is and plan on fixing this for the desktop version._

## Support and contact details

_Please feel free to collaborate with me! You can fork my repository or feel free to e-mail me with any comments, questions, or feedback._

## Technologies Used

_This webpage is built using HTML, CSS, and a Bootstrap Stylesheet._
