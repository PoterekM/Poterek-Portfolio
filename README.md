## Description

_{This webpage contains an initial index page with 3 subsections: resume, portfolio, and a bit about me. This is so a party interested in collaborating can navigate to the subsection they find most relevant to the aspect that they find most important when finding a web developer.}_

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Bootstrap v3.3.7 is being used. If for any reason bootstrap becomes incompatible, please use the Bootstrap CSS CDN and use that link in the top of the styleseets instead_
* _The webpage will largely work without internet connection once pages are loaded except for the background-image in the About Me_


## Known Bugs
